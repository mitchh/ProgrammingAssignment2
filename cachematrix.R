# Programming assingment 2 for https://class.coursera.org/rprog-005
# Mitch Hendrickson

# Per the assignment, we write a couple of functions to demonstrate/duplicate 
# the vector caching described in the assignemnt, but this time for matrices

## Create a "matrix" which is really a list of operation functions and has a place to 
## stash a cache of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Inverse finder for out casching matrix which will use the cached version if it can

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
